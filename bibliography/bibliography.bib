abstract = {Context The worsening hospital nurse shortage and recent California legislation mandating minimum hospital patient-to-nurse ratios demand an understanding of how nurse staffing levels affect patient outcomes and nurse retention in hospital practice. Objective To determine the association between the patient-to-nurse ratio and patient mortality, failure-to-rescue (deaths following complications) among surgical patients, and factors related to nurse retention. Design, Setting, and Participants Cross-sectional analyses of linked data from 10184 staff nurses surveyed, 232342 general, orthopedic, and vascular surgery patients discharged from the hospital between April 1, 1998, and November 30, 1999 and administrative data from 168 nonfederal adult general hospitals in Pennsylvania. Main Outcome Measures Risk-adjusted patient mortality and failure-to-rescue within 30 days of admission, and nurse-reported job dissatisfaction and job-related burnout. Results After adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics (size, teaching status, and technology), each additional patient per nurse was associated with a 7{\%} (odds ratio [OR], 1.07; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.03-1.12) increase in the likelihood of dying within 30 days of admission and a 7{\%} (OR, 1.07; 95{\%} CI, 1.02-1.11) increase in the odds of failure-to-rescue. After adjusting for nurse and hospital characteristics, each additional patient per nurse was associated with a 23{\%} (OR, 1.23; 95{\%} CI, 1.13-1.34) increase in the odds of burnout and a 15{\%} (OR, 1.15; 95{\%} CI, 1.07-1.25) increase in the odds of job dissatisfaction. Conclusions In hospitals with high patient-to-nurse ratios, surgical patients experience higher risk-adjusted 30-day mortality and failure-to-rescue rates, and nurses, are more likely to experience burnout and job dissatisfaction.},

abstract = {Machine learning is one of the fastest growing areas of computer science, with far-reaching applications. The aim of this textbook is to introduce machine learning, and the algorithmic paradigms it offers, in a principled way. The book provides an extensive theoretical account of the fundamental ideas underlying machine learning and the mathematical derivations that transform these principles into practical algorithms. Following a presentation of the basics of the field, the book covers a wide array of central topics that have not been addressed by previous textbooks. These include a discussion of the computational complexity of learning and the concepts of convexity and stability; important algorithmic paradigms including stochastic gradient descent, neural networks, and structured output learning; and emerging theoretical concepts such as the PAC-Bayes approach and compression-based bounds. Designed for an advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate course, the text makes the fundamentals and algorithms of machine learning accessible to students and non-expert readers in statistics, computer science, mathematics, and engineering.},

Key covariates included hospital occupancy and patient-level characteristics.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The LOS increased as workload increased, particularly at lower hospital occupancy. For hospital occupancies less than 75{\%}, LOS increased from 5.5 to 7.5 days as workload increased. For occupancies of 75{\%} to 85{\%}, LOS increased exponentially above a daily relative value unit of approximately 25 and a census value of approximately 15. At high occupancy ({\textgreater}85{\%}), LOS was J-shaped, with significant increases at higher ranges of workload. After controlling for LOS, cost increased by {\$}111 for each 1-unit increase in relative value unit and {\$}205 for each 1-unit increase in census across the range of values. Changes in workload were not associated with the remaining outcomes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Increasing hospitalist workload is associated with clinically meaningful increases in LOS and cost. Although our findings should be validated in different clinical settings, our results suggest the need for methods to mitigate the potential negative effects of increased hospitalist workload on the efficiency and cost of care.},

An imbalance occurs when one or more classes have very low proportions in the training data as compared to the other classes. Imbalance can be present in any data set or application, and hence, the practitioner should be aware of the implications of modeling this type of data. To illustrate the impacts and remedies for severe class imbalance, we present a case study example (Section 16.1) and the impact of class imbalance on performances measures (Section 16.2). Sections 16.3-16.6 describe approaches for handling imbalance using the existing data such as maximizing minority class accuracy, adjusting classification cut-offs or prior probabilities, or adjusting sample weights prior to model tuning. Handling imbalance can also be done through sophisticated up- or down-sampling methods (Section 16.7) or by applying costs to the classification errors (Section 16.8). In the Computing Section (16.9) we demonstrate how to implement these remedies in R. Finally, exercises are provided at the end of the chapter to solidify the concepts.},

Hospitals with bed occupancy rates of above 85 percent are generally considered to have bed shortages. Little attention has been paid to the impact of these shortages on patients' outcomes. We analyzed all 2.65 million admissions to Danish hospitals' departments of medicine in the period 1995-2012. We found that high bed occupancy rates were associated with a significant 9 percent increase in rates of in-hospital mortality and thirty-day mortality, compared to low bed occupancy rates. Being admitted to a hospital outside of normal working hours or on a weekend or holiday was also significantly associated with increased mortality. The health risks of bed shortages, including mortality, could be better documented as a priority health issue. Resources should be allocated to researching the causes and effects of bed shortages, with the aim of creating greater interest in exploring new methods to avoid or reduce bed shortages.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES:The associations between emergency department (ED) crowding and patient outcomes have not been investigated comprehensively in different types of ED. The study objective was to examine the associations of changes over time in ED occupancy with patient outcomes in a sample of EDs that vary by size and location. A secondary objective was to explore whether the relationship between ED occupancy and patient outcomes differed by ED characteristics (size/type and medical and nursing staffing ratios).METHODS:Using linked administrative databases, the authors constructed a cohort of 677,475 patients who visited one of 42 hospital EDs with complete data for 2005 on ED bed and waiting room occupancy. Crowding was measured with the relative occupancy ratio separately for ED bed and waiting room patients, defined as the ratio of ED occupancy on the day of the index ED visit to the average annual occupancy at that same ED. Multivariable logistic regression (adjusting for patient and ED characteristics) was used to analyze 30-day outcomes: mortality, return ED visits, and hospital admission at the first return ED visit.RESULTS:After adjustment for ED and patient characteristics, a 10{\%} increase in ED bed relative occupancy ratio was associated with 3{\%} increases in death and hospital admission at a return visit. A 10{\%} increase in ED waiting room crowding was associated with a small decrease in return visits. There was a stronger association between bed crowding and mortality among larger EDs.CONCLUSIONS:In Quebec EDs, increases in bed occupancy are associated with an increase in the rates of 30-day adverse outcomes, even after adjustment for patient and ED characteristics. The results raise important concerns about the quality of care during periods of ED crowding.},

abstract = {Early and accurate prediction of hospital length-of-stay (LOS) in patients undergoing knee replacement is important for economic and operational reasons. Few studies have systematically developed a multivariable model to predict LOS. We performed a retrospective cohort study of 1609 patients aged ≥ 50 years who underwent elective, primary total or unicompartmental knee replacements. Pre-operative candidate predictors included patient demographics, knee function, self-reported measures, surgical factors and discharge plans. In order to develop the model, multivariable regression with bootstrap internal validation was used. The median LOS for the sample was four days (interquartile range 4 to 5). Statistically significant predictors of longer stay included older age, greater number of comorbidities, less knee flexion range of movement, frequent feelings of being down and depressed, greater walking aid support required, total (versus unicompartmental) knee replacement, bilateral surgery, low-volume surgeon, absence of carer at home, and expectation to receive step-down care. For ease of use, these ten variables were used to construct a nomogram-based prediction model which showed adequate predictive accuracy (optimism-corrected R2 = 0.32) and calibration. If externally validated, a prediction model using easily and routinely obtained pre-operative measures may be used to predict absolute LOS in patients following knee replacement and help to better manage these patients. {\textcopyright} 2013 The British Editorial Society of Bone {\&} Joint Surgery.},

abstract = {Background: The limitations of current prognostic models in identifying postoperative cardiac patients at risk of experiencing morbidity and subsequently an extended intensive care unit length of stay (ICU LOS) is well recognized. This coupled with the desire for risk stratification in order to prioritise medical intervention has lead to the need for the development of a system that can accurately predict individual patient outcome based on both preoperative and immediate postoperative clinical factors. The usefulness of artificial neural networks (ANNs) as an outcome prediction tool in the critical care environment has been previously demonstrated for medical intensive care unit (ICU) patients and it is the aim of this study to apply this methodology to postoperative cardiac patients. Methods: A review of contemporary literature revealed 15 preoperative risk factors and 17 operative and postoperative variables that have a determining effect on LOS. An integrated, multi-functional software package was developed to automate the ANN development process. The efficacy of the resultant individual ANNs as well as groupings or ensembles of ANNs were measured by calculating sensitivity and specificity estimates as well as the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) when the ANN is applied to an independent test dataset. Results: The individual ANN with the highest discriminating ability produced an AUC of 0.819. The use of the ensembles of networks technique significantly improved the classification accuracy. Consolidating the output of three ANNs improved the AUC to 0.90. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the suitability of ANNs, in particular ensembles of ANNs, to outcome prediction tasks in postoperative cardiac patients. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Saar2007,
abstract = {Much work has studied the effect of different treatments of missing values on model induction, but little work has analyzed treatments for the common case of missing values at prediction time. This paper first compares several different methods—predictive value imputation, the distributionbased imputation used by C4.5, and using reduced models—for applying classification trees to instances with missing values (and also shows evidence that the results generalize to bagged trees and to logistic regression). The results show that for the two most popular treatments, each is preferable under different conditions. Strikingly the reduced-models approach, seldom mentioned or used, consistently outperforms the other two methods, sometimes by a large margin. The lack of attention to reduced modeling may be due in part to its (perceived) expense in terms of computation or storage. Therefore, we then introduce and evaluate alternative, hybrid approaches that allow users to balance between more accurate but computationally expensive reduced modeling and the other, less accurate but less computationally expensive treatments. The results show that the hybrid methods can scale gracefully to the amount of investment in computation/storage, and that they outperform imputation even for small investments.},
