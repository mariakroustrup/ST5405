abstract = {BACKGROUND: Predictive modeling is a key component of solutions to many healthcare problems. Among all predictive modeling approaches, machine learning methods often achieve the highest prediction accuracy, but suffer from a long-standing open problem precluding their widespread use in healthcare. Most machine learning models give no explanation for their prediction results, whereas interpretability is essential for a predictive model to be adopted in typical healthcare settings.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: This paper presents the first complete method for automatically explaining results for any machine learning predictive model without degrading accuracy. We did a computer coding implementation of the method. Using the electronic medical record data set from the Practice Fusion diabetes classification competition containing patient records from all 50 states in the United States, we demonstrated the method on predicting type 2 diabetes diagnosis within the next year.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: For the champion machine learning model of the competition, our method explained prediction results for 87.4 {\%} of patients who were correctly predicted by the model to have type 2 diabetes diagnosis within the next year.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our demonstration showed the feasibility of automatically explaining results for any machine learning predictive model without degrading accuracy.},

abstract = {When modeling discrete classes, the relative frequencies of the classes can have a significant impact on the effectiveness of the model. An imbalance occurs when one or more classes have very low proportions in the training data as compared to the other classes. Imbalance can be present in any data set or application, and hence, the practitioner should be aware of the implications of modeling this type of data. To illustrate the impacts and remedies for severe class imbalance, we present a case study example (Section 16.1) and the impact of class imbalance on performances measures (Section 16.2). Sections 16.3-16.6 describe approaches for handling imbalance using the existing data such as maximizing minority class accuracy, adjusting classification cut-offs or prior probabilities, or adjusting sample weights prior to model tuning. Handling imbalance can also be done through sophisticated up- or down-sampling methods (Section 16.7) or by applying costs to the classification errors (Section 16.8). In the Computing Section (16.9) we demonstrate how to implement these remedies in R. Finally, exercises are provided at the end of the chapter to solidify the concepts.},

abstract = {Machine learning is one of the fastest growing areas of computer science, with far-reaching applications. The aim of this textbook is to introduce machine learning, and the algorithmic paradigms it offers, in a principled way. The book provides an extensive theoretical account of the fundamental ideas underlying machine learning and the mathematical derivations that transform these principles into practical algorithms. Following a presentation of the basics of the field, the book covers a wide array of central topics that have not been addressed by previous textbooks. These include a discussion of the computational complexity of learning and the concepts of convexity and stability; important algorithmic paradigms including stochastic gradient descent, neural networks, and structured output learning; and emerging theoretical concepts such as the PAC-Bayes approach and compression-based bounds. Designed for an advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate course, the text makes the fundamentals and algorithms of machine learning accessible to students and non-expert readers in statistics, computer science, mathematics, and engineering.},

@article{Aiken2002,
abstract = {Context The worsening hospital nurse shortage and recent California legislation mandating minimum hospital patient-to-nurse ratios demand an understanding of how nurse staffing levels affect patient outcomes and nurse retention in hospital practice. Objective To determine the association between the patient-to-nurse ratio and patient mortality, failure-to-rescue (deaths following complications) among surgical patients, and factors related to nurse retention. Design, Setting, and Participants Cross-sectional analyses of linked data from 10184 staff nurses surveyed, 232342 general, orthopedic, and vascular surgery patients discharged from the hospital between April 1, 1998, and November 30, 1999 and administrative data from 168 nonfederal adult general hospitals in Pennsylvania. Main Outcome Measures Risk-adjusted patient mortality and failure-to-rescue within 30 days of admission, and nurse-reported job dissatisfaction and job-related burnout. Results After adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics (size, teaching status, and technology), each additional patient per nurse was associated with a 7{\%} (odds ratio [OR], 1.07; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.03-1.12) increase in the likelihood of dying within 30 days of admission and a 7{\%} (OR, 1.07; 95{\%} CI, 1.02-1.11) increase in the odds of failure-to-rescue. After adjusting for nurse and hospital characteristics, each additional patient per nurse was associated with a 23{\%} (OR, 1.23; 95{\%} CI, 1.13-1.34) increase in the odds of burnout and a 15{\%} (OR, 1.15; 95{\%} CI, 1.07-1.25) increase in the odds of job dissatisfaction. Conclusions In hospitals with high patient-to-nurse ratios, surgical patients experience higher risk-adjusted 30-day mortality and failure-to-rescue rates, and nurses, are more likely to experience burnout and job dissatisfaction.},

Key covariates included hospital occupancy and patient-level characteristics.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The LOS increased as workload increased, particularly at lower hospital occupancy. For hospital occupancies less than 75{\%}, LOS increased from 5.5 to 7.5 days as workload increased. For occupancies of 75{\%} to 85{\%}, LOS increased exponentially above a daily relative value unit of approximately 25 and a census value of approximately 15. At high occupancy ({\textgreater}85{\%}), LOS was J-shaped, with significant increases at higher ranges of workload. After controlling for LOS, cost increased by {\$}111 for each 1-unit increase in relative value unit and {\$}205 for each 1-unit increase in census across the range of values. Changes in workload were not associated with the remaining outcomes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Increasing hospitalist workload is associated with clinically meaningful increases in LOS and cost. Although our findings should be validated in different clinical settings, our results suggest the need for methods to mitigate the potential negative effects of increased hospitalist workload on the efficiency and cost of care.},

@article{McCusker2014,
abstract = {OBJECTIVES:The associations between emergency department (ED) crowding and patient outcomes have not been investigated comprehensively in different types of ED. The study objective was to examine the associations of changes over time in ED occupancy with patient outcomes in a sample of EDs that vary by size and location. A secondary objective was to explore whether the relationship between ED occupancy and patient outcomes differed by ED characteristics (size/type and medical and nursing staffing ratios).METHODS:Using linked administrative databases, the authors constructed a cohort of 677,475 patients who visited one of 42 hospital EDs with complete data for 2005 on ED bed and waiting room occupancy. Crowding was measured with the relative occupancy ratio separately for ED bed and waiting room patients, defined as the ratio of ED occupancy on the day of the index ED visit to the average annual occupancy at that same ED. Multivariable logistic regression (adjusting for patient and ED characteristics) was used to analyze 30-day outcomes: mortality, return ED visits, and hospital admission at the first return ED visit.RESULTS:After adjustment for ED and patient characteristics, a 10{\%} increase in ED bed relative occupancy ratio was associated with 3{\%} increases in death and hospital admission at a return visit. A 10{\%} increase in ED waiting room crowding was associated with a small decrease in return visits. There was a stronger association between bed crowding and mortality among larger EDs.CONCLUSIONS:In Quebec EDs, increases in bed occupancy are associated with an increase in the rates of 30-day adverse outcomes, even after adjustment for patient and ED characteristics. The results raise important concerns about the quality of care during periods of ED crowding.},

Hospitals with bed occupancy rates of above 85 percent are generally considered to have bed shortages. Little attention has been paid to the impact of these shortages on patients' outcomes. We analyzed all 2.65 million admissions to Danish hospitals' departments of medicine in the period 1995-2012. We found that high bed occupancy rates were associated with a significant 9 percent increase in rates of in-hospital mortality and thirty-day mortality, compared to low bed occupancy rates. Being admitted to a hospital outside of normal working hours or on a weekend or holiday was also significantly associated with increased mortality. The health risks of bed shortages, including mortality, could be better documented as a priority health issue. Resources should be allocated to researching the causes and effects of bed shortages, with the aim of creating greater interest in exploring new methods to avoid or reduce bed shortages.},
